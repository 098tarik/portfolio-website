<p>Full Stack Developer & Software Engineer</p>

<p><i>This website is a personal project built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy to showcase my skills in modern web development, API design, and full-stack engineering. This website was made through AI-Assisted Development.</i></p>


<h2>Featured Projects</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/098tarik/tloc-tool">tloc-tool</a></strong></p>
<p>A custom C++ command-line utility that recursively analyzes a codebase to count total lines, blank lines, comment lines, and source lines. Designed to aid codebase metrics collection and quality analysis, it demonstrates proficiency with filesystem traversal, parsing logic, and low-level tooling development.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/098tarik/jumping-ball-the-game">jumping-ball-the-game</a></strong></p>
<p>A 2D game written in C++ using the <em>raylib</em> graphics library, showcasing game loop architecture, real-time input handling, rendering, and asset management. This project reflects experience with event-driven programming and real-time systems — valuable for interactive software and engine-level work.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/098tarik/portfolio-website">portfolio-website</a></strong></p>
<p>The code for my personal portfolio site that centralizes my public work and professional identity. This project highlights front-end development skills, responsive design fundamentals, and static web deployment.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/098tarik/custom-file-system">custom-file-system</a></strong></p>
<p>A low-level C implementation of a custom file system, demonstrating a deep understanding of OS abstractions, storage structures, block allocation, and metadata management. This project shows capability with systems programming and data structures in “bare-metal” environments. This was done during my undergraduate Operating Systems course.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/098tarik/custom-virtual-memory-model">custom-virtual-memory-model</a></strong></p>
<p>A C-language virtual memory modeling project that simulates memory management behaviors such as allocation, paging, and address translation. This showcases strong systems knowledge relevant to OS internals, memory abstraction, and performance reasoning. This was done during my undergraduate Operating Systems course.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/098tarik/leetcode-portfolio">leetcode-portfolio</a></strong></p>
<p>A Python repository collecting algorithm solutions and data structure implementations, demonstrating analytical problem-solving skills, familiarity with complexity trade-offs, and mastering common coding interview patterns.</p>
